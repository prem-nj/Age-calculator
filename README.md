- Accurate age calculation that considers:
  - Leap years.
  - Differences in days and months.
- Displays the age in a formatted and easy-to-read style.
- Responsive design for optimal display across devices.

#### **How It Works**
1. **Input Date**: Users select their date of birth using an HTML `<input type="date">` field.
2. **Calculate Button**: When the "Calculate" button is clicked, the age is calculated by comparing the selected date with the current date.
3. **Display Age**: The calculated age is displayed dynamically in the format:
   ```
   You are X years, Y months, and Z days old.
   ```
4. **Validation**: If no date is entered, the app prompts the user to provide a valid date.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for visual aesthetics.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for age calculation and interactivity.
